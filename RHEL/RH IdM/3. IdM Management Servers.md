The IdM servers act as central repositories for identity and policy information. They also host the services used by domain members.

#### Services Hosted by IdM Servers

Most of the following services are not strictly required to be installed on the IdM server. For example, services such as a certificate authority (CA), a DNS server, or a Network Time Protocol (NTP) server can be installed on an external server outside the IdM domain.

Kerberos: `krb5kdc` and `kadmin`   ---- see the [Using Kerberos](https://access.redhat.com/documentation/en-us/red_hat_enterprise_linux/7/html-single/system-level_authentication_guide/index#Using_Kerberos)

LDAP directory server: `dirsrv`

Certificate Authority: `pki-tomcatd`

Domain Name System (DNS): `named`

Network Time Protocol: `ntpd`

```
By default, IdM uses the _Network Time Protocol (NTP)_ to synchronize clocks over a network via the `ntpd` service. With NTP, a central server acts as an authoritative clock and the clients synchronize their times to match the server clock. The IdM server is configured as the NTP server for the IdM domain during the server installation process.

Running an NTP server on an IdM server installed on a virtual machine can lead to inaccurate time synchronization in some environments. To avoid potential problems, do not run NTP on IdM servers installed on virtual machines. For more information on the reliability of an NTP server on a virtual machine, see [this Knowledgebase solution](https://access.redhat.com/solutions/361803).

Apache HTTP Server: `httpd`

The _Apache HTTP web server_ provides the IdM Web UI, and also manages communication between the Certificate Authority and other IdM services.
