There are three parts to role-based access controls: the _permission_, the _privilege_ and the _role_. A privilege consists of one or more permissions, and a role consists of one or more privileges.


### Permission 

Defines a specific operation or set of operations (such as read, write, add or delete) and the target entries within the IdM LDAP directory to which those operations apply.

### Privilege

A group of permissions that can be applied to a role.  

For example, a permission can be created to add, edit, and delete automount locations. Then that permission can be combined with another permission relating to managing FTP services, and they can be used to create a single privilege that relates to managing filesystems.

### Role

A list of privilege's which users specified for the role posses.
