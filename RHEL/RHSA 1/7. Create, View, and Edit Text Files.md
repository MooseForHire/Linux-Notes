## Redirect Output to a File or Program

### Standard Input, Standard Output, and Standard Error

A running program, or _process_, reads input and writes output. When you run a command from the shell prompt, it normally reads its input from the keyboard and sends its output to the terminal window.

A process uses numbered channels called _file descriptors_ to get input and send output.

All processes start with at least three file descriptors:

_Standard input_ (channel 0) reads input from the keyboard. 
_Standard output_ (channel 1) sends normal output to the terminal. 
_Standard error_ (channel 2) sends error messages to the terminal.

## Channels:

|Number|Channel name|Description|Default connection|Usage|
|:--|:--|:--|:--|:--|
|0|`stdin`|Standard input|Keyboard|Read only|
|1|`stdout`|Standard output|Terminal|Write only|
|2|`stderr`|Standard error|Terminal|Write only|
|3+|```filename```|Other files|None|Read, write, or both|


### Redirect Output to a File

The Input/Output (I/O) redirection changes how the process gets its input or output. Instead of getting input from the keyboard, or sending output and errors to the terminal, the process can read from or write to files. With redirection, you can save the messages to a file instead of displaying the output on the terminal. Alternatively, you can use redirection to discard output or errors, so they are not displayed on the terminal or saved.


## Output Redirection Operators

`> file`  Redirects `stdout` to overwrite a file.

`>> file` Redirects `stdout` to append to a file.

`2> file` Redirects `stderr` to overwrite a file. Errors go to `file` instead of terminal. 

`2>/dev/null` Discards `stderr` messages by directing them to `/dev/null`

========================================================

`> file 2>&1` Redirect `stdout` and `stderr` to overwrite the same file.
`&>` does the same thing.

`>> file 2>&1`  Redirect `stdout` and `stderr` to append to the same file.
`&>> file`

## Construct Pipelines

A _pipeline_ is a sequence of one or more commands that are separated by the vertical bar character (`|`). A pipeline connects the standard output of the first command to the standard input of the next command.

When you combine redirection with a pipeline, the shell sets up the entire pipeline first, and then it redirects the input/output. If you use output redirection in the _middle_ of a pipeline, then the output goes to the file and not to the next command in the pipeline.

In the next example, the output of the `ls` command goes to the `/tmp/saved-output` file, and the `less` command displays nothing on the terminal.

```
[user@host ~]$ ls > /tmp/saved-output | less
```

The `tee` command overcomes this limitation. In a pipeline, `tee` copies its standard input to its standard output and also redirects its standard output to the files that are given as arguments to the command. If you imagine data as water that flows through a pipeline, then you can visualize `tee` as a "T" joint in the pipe that directs output in two directions.

Sends output to both the screen and a file at the same time?

The next example redirects the output of the `ls` command to the `/tmp/saved-output` file and passes it to the `less` command, so it is displayed on the terminal one screen at a time.

`[user@host ~]$ ls -l | tee /tmp/saved-output | less`

Use the `tee` command `-a` option to append the content to a file instead of overwriting it.

`[user@host ~]$ ls -l | tee -a /tmp/append-files`

You can redirect standard error through a pipeline, but you cannot use the merging redirection operators (`&>` and `&>>`). The following example is the correct way to redirect both standard output and standard error through a pipeline:

`[user@host ~]$ find / -name passwd 2>&1 | less`

=======================================================

- The **u*** key undoes the most recent edit.
- The **x*** key deletes a single character.

A **v** keystroke enters _visual mode_, where multiple characters might be selected for text manipulation.

In Vim, you can _yank_ and _put_ (copy and paste), by using the **y** and **p** command characters. Position the cursor on the first character to select, and then enter visual mode. Use the arrow keys to expand the visual selection. When ready, press **y** to _yank_ the selection into memory. Position the cursor at the new location, and then press **p** to _put_ the selection at the cursor.

=========================================================

# Change the Shell Environment

Set shell variables to run commands, and edit Bash startup scripts to set shell and environment variables to modify the behavior of the shell and programs that are run from the shell.

Shell variables are unique to a particular shell session. If you have two terminal windows open, or two independent login sessions to the same remote server, then you are running two shells. Each shell has its own set of values for its shell variables.

You can use the `set` command to list all shell variables that are currently set.

### Configure Programs with Environment Variables

The shell provides an _environment_ for the programs that you run from that shell. Among other items, this environment includes information about the current working directory on the file system, the command-line options that are passed to the program, and the values of _environment variables_. The programs might use these environment variables to change their behavior or their default settings.

If a shell variable is not an environment variable, then only the shell can use it. However, if a shell variable is an environment variable, then the shell and any programs that run from that shell can use the variable.

You can assign any variable that is defined in the shell as an environment variable by marking it for export with the `export` command.

```
[user@host ~]$ EDITOR=vim
[user@host ~]$ export EDITOR
```

You can set and export a variable in one step:

```
[user@host ~]$ export EDITOR=vim
```

Another important environment variable is `PATH`. The `PATH` variable contains a list of colon-separated directories that contain programs:

```
[user@host ~]$ echo $PATH

/home/user/.local/bin:/home/user/bin:/usr/share/Modules/bin:/usr/local/bin:/usr/bin:/usr/local/sbin:/usr/sbin
````

When you run a command such as the `ls` command, the shell looks for the `ls` executable file in each of those directories in order, and runs the first matching file that it finds. (On a typical system, this file is `/usr/bin/ls`.)

You can append directories to your `PATH` variable. For example, perhaps you want to run some executable programs or scripts such as regular commands in the `/home/user/sbin` directory. You can append the `/home/user/sbin` directory to your `PATH` for the current session as follows:

`[user@host ~]$ export PATH=${PATH}:/home/user/sbin`

List all environment variables using the `env` command.

=========================================================

### Set Variables Automatically

When Bash starts, several text files run with shell commands that initialize the shell environment. To set shell or environment variables automatically when your shell starts, you can edit these Bash startup scripts.

- Interactive shell: User directly enters commands into this. 
- Login shell: Invoked when a user logs in locally via the terminal or via SSH.
- Non-login shell: Invoked from an existing session, such as to open a terminal from the GNOME GUI.

- Non-interactive shell: Runs in the background without user intervention


Interactive Login Shells (User ssh to a host), These files configure the Bash environment:

```
/etc/profile
~/.bash_profile

Also source these files:

/etc/bashrc
~/.bashrc
```

Interactive Non-Login Shells:

```
/etc/bashrc
~/.bashrc
```

`/etc/profile` and `/etc/bashrc` Apply to the whole system.
`~/.bashrc` and `~/.bash_profile` Are user specific.

To create a variable that is available to all of your interactive shells, edit the `~/.bashrc` file. 

To apply a variable only once after the user logs in, define it in the `~/.bash_profile` file.

For example, to change the default editor when you log in via SSH, you can modify the `EDITOR` variable in your `~/.bash_profile` file:

```
# .bash_profile

# Get the aliases and functions
if [ -f ~/.bashrc ]; then
        . ~/.bashrc
fi

# User specific environment and startup programs
`export EDITOR=nano`
```

#### Bash Aliases

Bash aliases are shortcuts to other Bash commands. For example, if you must often type a long command, then you can create a shorter alias to invoke it. You use the `alias` command to create aliases. Consider the following example, which creates a `hello` alias for an `echo` command.

```
[user@host ~]$ alias hello=echo "Hello, this is a long string."
```

You can then run the `hello` command and it invokes the `echo` command.


```
[user@host ~]$ hello
Hello, this is a long string.
```

Add aliases to a user's `~/.bashrc` file so they are available in any interactive shell.
