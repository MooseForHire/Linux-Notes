LABS:

To prepare your lab environment at the start of each hands-on activity, run the `lab start` command with a specified activity name from the activity's instructions. Likewise, at the end of each hands-on activity, run the `lab finish` command with that same activity name to clean up after the activity.

`[student@workstation ~]$ lab action exercise`

action = start, grade, or finish
