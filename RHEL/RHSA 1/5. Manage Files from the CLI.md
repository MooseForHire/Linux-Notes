- _Persistent_ content remains after a reboot, such as configuration settings.
- _Runtime_ content from a process or from the system is deleted on reboot.

|   |   |
|---|---|
|`/etc`|System-specific configuration files.|


|   |   |
|---|---|
|`/run`|Runtime data for processes that started since the last boot. This data includes process ID files and lock files. The contents of this directory are re-created on reboot. This directory consolidates the `/var/run` and `/var/lock` directories from earlier versions of Red Hat Enterprise Linux.|

|   |   |
|---|---|
|`/usr`|Installed software, shared libraries, including files, and read-only program data. Significant subdirectories in the `/usr` directory include the following commands:<br><br>- `/usr/bin`: User commands<br>    <br>- `/usr/sbin`: System administration commands<br>    <br>- `/usr/local`: Locally customized software|

|   |   |
|---|---|
|`/var`|System-specific variable data should persist between boots. Files that dynamically change, such as databases, cache directories, log files, printer-spooled documents, and website content, might be found under `/var`.|


In Red Hat Enterprise Linux 7 and later, four older directories in `/` have identical contents to their counterparts in `/usr`:

- `/bin` and `/usr/bin`
- `/sbin` and `/usr/sbin`
- `/lib` and `/usr/lib`
- `/lib64` and `/usr/lib64`

In Red Hat Enterprise Linux 7 and later, the directories in `/` are symbolic links to the matching directories in `/usr`.

/root ---- superusers home directory

One dot (`.`) refers to the current directory, and two dots (`..`) refer to the parent directory. These special directories exist in every directory on the system, and they are useful when using file management commands.

=====================================================

The `mkdir` command `-p` (_parent_) option creates any missing parent directories for the requested destination.

```
[user@host Documents]$ mkdir -p Thesis/Chapter1 Thesis/Chapter2 Thesis/Chapter3
[user@host Documents]$ ls -R Thesis/
Thesis/:
Chapter1  Chapter2  Chapter3

Thesis/Chapter1:

Thesis/Chapter2:

Thesis/Chapter3:
```

=======================================================

`cp <file to be copied> <name of new file>`
`cp <file to be copied> /home/csteen/Documents`

Shell Expansions

Main types of expansions:

- Brace
- Tilde
- Variable
- Command Substitution
- Pathname Expansion (also called Globbing)

## Pathname Expansions and Pattern Matching

Pathname expansion expands a pattern of special characters that represent wild cards or classes of characters into a list of file names that match the pattern.

Before the shell runs your command, it replaces the pattern with the list of file names that matched.

If the pattern does not match anything, then the shell tries to use the pattern as a literal argument for the command that it runs.

``` 
? -- Any single character
[abc...] -- Any one character in the enclosed class (between brackets)
[!abc...] -- Any one character not in the brackets
[[:alpha:]] -- Any alphebetic character
[[:lower:]] -- Any lowercase character
...

```

Lets look at examples:

`ls [ac]*`  --- this will list files that begin with either an `a` or `c` , followed by any number of characters.

`ls ????`  --- This will list file names that are 4 characters in length.

## Brace Expansion

Brace expansion is used to generate "discretionary" strings of characters. Braces contain a comma-separated list of strings, or a sequence expression. The result includes the text that precedes or follows the brace definition.

You can use double dot syntax: `..` which expands to a sequence.

Example:

```
$ echo {Sunday,Monday,Tuesday,Wednesday}.log
Sunday.log Monday.log Tuesday.log Wednesday.log

$ echo file{1..3}.txt
file1.txt file2.txt file3.txt

$ echo file{a,b}{1,2}.txt
filea1.txt filea2.txt fileb1.txt fileb2.txt

$ echo file{a{1,2},b,c}.txt
filea1.txt filea2.txt fileb.txt filec.txt

$ mkdir ../RHEL{7,8,9}
$ ls ../RHEL*
RHEL7 RHEL8 RHEL9
```

## Tilde Expansion

The tilde character (~), matches the current user's home directory.

```
$ echo ~/csteen
/home/user/csteen
```

## Variable Expansion

A variable acts like a named container that stores a value in memory. Variable names can go into curly braces 

Variable names can contain only letters (uppercase and lowercase), numbers, and underscores. Variable names are case-sensitive and cannot start with a number.


`VARIABLENAME=value`

```
$ USERNAME=csteen
$ echo ${USERNAME}
csteen
$ echo $USERNAME
csteen
```

## Command Substitution

Command substitution enables the output of a command to replace the command itself on the command line. 

Command substitution occurs when you enclose a command in parentheses and precede it by a dollar sign (`$`). The ``$(command)`` form can nest multiple command expansions inside each other.

Example:

```
%Y = Year
%m = Month
%d = Day
%H = Hour (00-23)
%l = Hour (1-12)
%M = Minute
%S = Second

%u = Day of the week (1-7)
%A = Full weekday name
%p = AM or PM



$ echo Today is $(date +%A)
Today is Wednesday

$ echo The time is $(date +%M) minutes past $(date +%1%p)
The time is 26 minutes past 11AM.

```


## Escape Characters

`\` is used to protect the following single character from expansion.

`''` is also used to protect longer strings. Stops ALL shell expansions.

`""` is also used to protect strings. Stops MOST shell expansions.

Double quotation marks suppress special characters other than the dollar sign (`$`), backslash (`\`), backtick, and exclamation point from operating inside the quoted text. 

Double quotation marks block pathname expansion, but still allow command substitution and variable expansion to occur.

Example:

```
$ myhost=$(hostname -s); echo $myhost
host

$ echo "***** hostname is ${myhost} *****"
***** hostname is host *****

$ echo 'Will variable $myhost evaluate to $(hostname -s)?'
Will variable $myhost evaluate to $(hostname -s)?


```
