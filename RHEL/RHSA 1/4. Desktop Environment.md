The _desktop environment_ is the graphical user interface on a Linux system. `GNOME 40` is the default desktop environment in Red Hat Enterprise Linux 9.

It provides an integrated desktop for users and a unified development platform on top of a graphical framework that either `Wayland` (by default) or the legacy `X Window System` provides.

`GNOME Shell` provides the core user interface functions for the GNOME desktop environment.
