# Access a Remote Command Line with ssh


SSH Client (The one about to run the ssh command)
SSH Server (The one you want to access)

1. I run `ssh elasticserver01.golden`
2. The server sends its public key to me.
3. My local OS saves server public key to either  `~/.ssh/known_hosts ` or `/etc/ssh/ssh_known_hosts`
4. My OS checks to see if I already have the public key in the above locations.
5. If it does, it compares the saved key to the one sent by the server.
6. If it does not match, it warns and prompts to confirm the connection.

Example:

```
[developer1@host ~]$ ssh hostb
The authenticity of host 'hostb (172.25.250.12)' can't be established.
ECDSA key fingerprint is SHA256:qaS0PToLrqlCO2XGklA0iY7CaP7aPKimerDoaUkv720.
Are you sure you want to continue connecting (yes/no)? no

[developer1@host ~]$ ssh-keygen -lf /etc/ssh/ssh_host_ecdsa_key.pub
256 SHA256:qaS0PToLrqlCO2XGklA0iY7CaP7aPKimerDoaUkv720 root@server (ECDSA)
```

The `ssh-keygen -lf` command is used to output the fingerprint of the target server.

Compare both fingerprints to ensure they match.


Your "trusted" or "known" host keys are stored in:

- The system-wide `/etc/ssh/ssh_known_hosts` file.
    
- The `~/.ssh/known_hosts` file in each user's home directory.


# Configure SSH Key-based Authentication

You can configure your account for **passwordless** access to SSH servers that enabled key-based authentication, which is based on public key encryption (PKI).

This involves generating a **private** key and a **public** key.

The process is similar:

1. I run `ssh elasticserver01.golden`
2. The server uses my public key to generate a challenge message.
3. The server sends the challenge message to me.
4. My machine must decrypt this message using my private key.
5. If the verification succeeds, the connection is trusted.

Your public and private keys are stored in:

- `~/.ssh/id_rsa`
- `~/.ssh/id_rsa.pub`

When you use `ssh-keygen` to generate your private key, you can choose to enter a password. If you set a password, then you must enter the password every time you use a private key. 

You can use `ssh-agent` key manager locally, which caches your password on first use in a login session, and then provides the passphrase for all subsequent private key use in the same login session.

Generated SSH keys are stored by default in the `.ssh` subdirectory of your home directory. To function correctly, the private key must be readable and writable only by the user that it belongs to (octal permissions 600).

In order to share your newly generated public key, you must copy it to the remote system:

```
[user@host ~]$ ssh-copy-id -i .ssh/key-with-pass.pub user@remotehost
```
