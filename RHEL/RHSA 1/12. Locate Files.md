### Locate Files by Name

The `locate` command searches for files based on the name or path to the file. The command is fast, because it looks up this information from the `mlocate` database. 

However, this database does not update in real time and requires frequent updates for accurate results. 

This feature also means that the `locate` command does not search for files that were created since the last database update.

The `locate` database updates automatically every day. However, the `root` user might issue the `updatedb` command to force an immediate update.

```
[root@host ~]# updatedb
```
