Source code becomes copyrighted when created, and the copyright holder controls the terms under which the software can be copied, adapted, and distributed. Users can use the software according to its software license.

When a copyright holder provides software under an open source license, they grant the user the right to run the program and to view, modify, compile, and redistribute the source to others, royalty-free.

# Types of Open Source Licenses


The developers of open source software can license their software in different ways. The software license terms control how the source can be combined with other code or reused. To be open source, licenses must allow users to freely use, view, change, compile, and distribute the code.

Two general classes of open source license are particularly important:

- _Copyleft_ licenses are designed to encourage keeping the code open source.
    
- _Permissive_ licenses are designed to maximize code reusability. You can use the source for any purpose if the copyright and license statements are preserved, including reusing code under more restrictive or proprietary licenses.

**Copyleft licenses:** GNU General Public License (GPL) and Lesser GNU Public License (LGPL)

**Permissive Licenses:** MIT/X11 license, the Simplified BSD license, and the Apache Software License 2.0.


Fedora - Community-driven distribution. Serves as a development lab and proving ground for features to be incorporated into CentOS Stream and RHEL products.

CentOS - Red Hat stabilizes the CentOS stream software to be ready for long-term support and standardization, and integrates it into RHEL.

Fedora

In general, packages start out in Fedora and are included into CentOS Stream only when they are considered mature in stability, security, performance, and customer demand.

CentOS Stream

CentOS Stream is the upstream project for RHEL. Development of the next RHEL version is transparent and open for community contributions that can directly influence the next release. CentOS Stream is a continuous integration and delivery distribution, with tested and stable nightly builds.

A benefit of CentOS Stream is that, as the source for RHEL development, it is available in all the same architectures as RHEL, including Intel/AMD x86_64, ARM64, IBM Power, and IBM Z.
