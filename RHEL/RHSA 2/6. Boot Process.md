High Level Process:

1. The machine is powered on. The system firmware, either modern UEFI or earlier BIOS, runs a Power On Self Test (POST) and starts to initialize the hardware.
	1. To enter setup, enter a key configuration (such as F2)

2.  The UEFI boot firmware is configured by searching for a bootable device, which searches for or configures the Master Boot Record (MBR) on all disks

3. The system firmware reads a boot loader from disk and then passes control of the system to the boot loader. On a Red Hat Enterprise Linux 9 system, the boot loader is the _Grand Unified Bootloader version 2 (GRUB2)_.

4. GRUB2 loads its configuration from the `/boot/grub2/grub.cfg` file for BIOS, and from the `/boot/efi/EFI/redhat/grub.cfg` file for UEFI, and displays a menu to select which kernel to boot.
	1. GRUB2 is configured by using the `/etc/grub.d/` directory and the `/etc/default/grub` file. The `grub2-mkconfig` command generates the `/boot/grub2/grub.cfg` or `/boot/efi/EFI/redhat/grub.cfg` files for BIOS or UEFI, respectively.

5.  After you select a kernel, or the timeout expires, the boot loader loads the kernel and _initramfs_ from disk and places them in memory. An `initramfs` image is an archive with the kernel modules for all the required hardware at boot, initialization scripts, and more.

6. The boot loader hands control over to the kernel, and passes in any specified options on the kernel command line in the boot loader, and the location of the `initramfs` image in memory.

7. The kernel initializes all hardware for which it can find a driver in the `initramfs` image, and then executes the `/sbin/init` script from the `initramfs` image as PID 1. On Red Hat Enterprise Linux 9, the `/sbin/init` script is a link to the `systemd` unit.

8. The `systemd` unit from the `initramfs` image executes all units for the `initrd.target` target. This unit includes mounting the root file system on disk to the `/sysroot` directory.

9. The kernel switches (pivots) the root file system from the `initramfs` image to the root file system in the `/sysroot` directory. The `systemd` unit then re-executes itself by using the installed copy of the `systemd` unit on the disk.

10. The `systemd` unit looks for a default target, which is either passed in from the kernel command line or is configured on the system. The `systemd` unit then starts (and stops) units to comply with the configuration for that target, and solves dependencies between units automatically

#### Select a Target at Runtime

On a running system, administrators can switch to a different target by using the `systemctl isolate` command.

```
[root@host ~]# systemctl isolate multi-user.target
```

Isolating a target stops all services that the target does not require (and its dependencies), and starts any required services that are not yet started.

#### Select a Different Target at Boot Time

To select a different target at boot time, append the ``systemd.unit=target.target`` option to the kernel command line from the boot loader.

For example, to boot the system into a rescue shell where you can change the system configuration with almost no services running, append the following option to the kernel command line from the boot loader:

```
systemd.unit=rescue.target
```

This configuration change affects only a single boot, and is a useful tool to troubleshoot the boot process.

To use this method to select a different target, use the following procedure:

1. Boot or reboot the system.
    
2. Interrupt the boot loader menu countdown by pressing any key (except **Enter**, which would initiate a normal boot).
    
3. Move the cursor to the kernel entry to start.
    
4. Press **e** to edit the current entry.
    
5. Move the cursor to the line that starts with `linux` which is the kernel command line.
    
6. Append ``systemd.unit=target.target``, for example, `systemd.unit=emergency.target`.
    
7. Press **Ctrl**+**x** to boot with these changes.
