#### MBR Partition Scheme

The _Master Boot Record_ (MBR) partitioning scheme is the standard on systems that run BIOS firmware. This scheme supports a maximum of **four primary partitions.**

#### GPT Partition Scheme

For systems that run _Unified Extensible Firmware Interface (UEFI)_ firmware, GPT is the standard for disk partitioning, and addresses the limitations of the MBR scheme. A GPT provides a maximum of 128 partitions.

### Swap Space Concepts

A _swap space_ is an area of a disk under the control of the Linux kernel memory management subsystem. The kernel uses swap space to supplement the system RAM by holding inactive pages in memory. 

- A system's _virtual memory_ encompasses the combined system RAM and swap space.

Because swap areas are on disk, swap is slow when compared with RAM. Although swap space augments system RAM, do not consider swap space as a sustainable solution for insufficient RAM for your workload.
