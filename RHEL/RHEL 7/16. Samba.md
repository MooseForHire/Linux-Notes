**Samba** is an open source implementation of the _Server Message Block_ (**SMB**) and _common Internet file system_ (`CIFS`) protocol, and **vsftpd**, the primary FTP server shipped with Red Hat Enterprise Linux.

The SMB protocol is used to access resources on a server, such as file shares and shared printers. Additionally, Samba implements the Distributed Computing Environment Remote Procedure Call (DCE RPC) protocol used by Microsoft Windows.


You can run Samba as:

- An Active Directory (AD) or NT4 domain member
- A standalone server
- An NT4 Primary Domain Controller (PDC) or Backup Domain Controller (BDC)

# Samba Services

`smbd`

This service provides file sharing and printing services using the SMB protocol. Additionally, the service is responsible for resource locking and for authenticating connecting users. The `smb` `systemd` service starts and stops the `smbd` daemon.

To use the `smbd` service, install the **samba** package.
