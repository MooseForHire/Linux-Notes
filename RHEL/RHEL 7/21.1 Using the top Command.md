The `top` command displays a real-time list of processes that are running on the system.

For each listed process, the `top` command displays:

 process ID (`PID`)
 The effective user name of the process owner (`USER`)
 The priority (`PR`)
 The nice value (`NI`)
 The amount of virtual memory the process uses (`VIRT`)
 The amount of non-swapped physical memory the process uses (`RES`)
 The amount of shared memory the process uses (`SHR`)
 The process status field `S`
 The percentage of the CPU (`%CPU`) and memory (`%MEM`) usage
 Cumulated CPU time (`TIME+`)
 Name of the executable file (`COMMAND`)

To sort with top:

u - Sorts the list by user
M - Sorts the list by memory usage
P - Sorts the list by CPU usage
