The following are some examples of actions that forward syslog messages over the network (note that all actions are preceded with a selector that selects all messages with any priority). To forward messages to `192.168.0.1` via the `UDP` protocol, type:

```
. @192.168.0.1
```

To forward messages to "example.com" using port 6514 and the `TCP` protocol, use:

```
. @example.com:6514
```
