Red Hat Enterprise Linux 7 is distributed with version 2 of the GNU GRand Unified Bootloader (GRUB 2), which allows the user to select an operating system or kernel to be loaded at system boot time. GRUB 2 also allows the user to pass arguments to the kernel.

## Introduction to GRUB 2

GRUB 2 reads its configuration from the `/boot/grub2/grub.cfg` file on traditional BIOS-based machines and from the `/boot/efi/EFI/redhat/grub.cfg` file on UEFI machines. This file contains menu information.

The GRUB 2 configuration file, `grub.cfg`, is generated during installation, or by invoking the **/usr/sbin/grub2-mkconfig** utility, and is automatically updated by `grubby` each time a new kernel is installed.

Normal operations on `grub.cfg`, such as the removal and addition of new kernels, should be done using the `grubby` tool and, for scripts, using `new-kernel-pkg` tool. If you use `grubby` to modify the default kernel the changes will be inherited when new kernels are installed.
