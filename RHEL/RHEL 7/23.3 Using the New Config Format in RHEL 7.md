In **rsyslog** version 7, installed by default for Red Hat Enterprise Linux 7 in the **rsyslog** package, a new configuration syntax is introduced. The syntax enhancement is enabled by the new configuration processor that relies on RainerScript. The legacy format is still fully supported and it is used by default in the `/etc/rsyslog.conf` configuration file.


RainerScript is a scripting language designed for processing network events and configuring event processors such as **rsyslog**.

The version of RainerScript in rsyslog version 7 implements the `input()` and `ruleset()` statements, which permit the `/etc/rsyslog.conf` configuration file to be written in the new syntax.

Compare the configuration written with legacy-style parameters:

```
$InputFileName /tmp/inputfile
$InputFileTag tag1:
$InputFileStateFile inputfile-state
$InputRunFileMonitor
```

and the same configuration with the use of the new format statement:

```
input(type="imfile" file="/tmp/inputfile" tag="tag1:" statefile="inputfile-state
```
