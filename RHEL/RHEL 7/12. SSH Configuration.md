There are two different sets of configuration files: those for client programs (that is, `ssh`, `scp`, and `sftp`), and those for the server (the `sshd` daemon).

System-wide SSH configuration information is stored in the `/etc/ssh/` directory

User-specific SSH configuration information is stored in `~/.ssh/` within the user’s home directory


|   |   |
|---|---|
|`/etc/ssh/moduli`|Contains Diffie-Hellman groups used for the Diffie-Hellman key exchange which is critical for constructing a secure transport layer. When keys are exchanged at the beginning of an SSH session, a shared, secret value is created which cannot be determined by either party alone. This value is then used to provide host authentication.|
|`/etc/ssh/ssh_config`|The default SSH client configuration file. Note that it is overridden by `~/.ssh/config` if it exists.|
|`/etc/ssh/sshd_config`|The configuration file for the `sshd` daemon.|
|`/etc/ssh/ssh_host_ecdsa_key`|The ECDSA private key used by the `sshd` daemon.|
|`/etc/ssh/ssh_host_ecdsa_key.pub`|The ECDSA public key used by the `sshd` daemon.|
|`/etc/ssh/ssh_host_rsa_key`|The RSA private key used by the `sshd` daemon for version 2 of the SSH protocol.|

User-Specific

|File|Description|
|:--|:--|
|`~/.ssh/authorized_keys`|Holds a list of authorized public keys for servers. When the client connects to a server, the server authenticates the client by checking its signed public key stored within this file.|
|`~/.ssh/id_ecdsa`|Contains the ECDSA private key of the user.|
|`~/.ssh/id_ecdsa.pub`|The ECDSA public key of the user.|
|`~/.ssh/id_rsa`|The RSA private key used by `ssh` for version 2 of the SSH protocol.|
|`~/.ssh/id_rsa.pub`|The RSA public key used by `ssh` for version 2 of the SSH protocol.|
|`~/.ssh/known_hosts`|Contains host keys of SSH servers accessed by the user. This file is very important for ensuring that the SSH client is connecting to the correct SSH server.|
