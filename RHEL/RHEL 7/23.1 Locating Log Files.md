A list of log files maintained by `rsyslogd` can be found in the `/etc/rsyslog.conf` configuration file. Most log files are located in the `/var/log/` directory. Some applications such as `httpd` and `samba` have a directory within `/var/log/` for their log files.

You may notice multiple files in the `/var/log/` directory with numbers after them (for example, `cron-20100906`). These numbers represent a time stamp that has been added to a rotated log file.

 Log files are rotated so their file sizes do not become too large. The `logrotate` package contains a cron task that automatically rotates log files according to the `/etc/logrotate.conf` configuration file and the configuration files in the `/etc/logrotate.d/` directory.
