# RSA

To generate an RSA key pair for version 2 of the SSH protocol, follow these steps:

1. Generate an RSA key pair by typing the following at a shell prompt:
```
 ~]$ ssh-keygen -t rsa
    Generating public/private rsa key pair.
    Enter file in which to save the key (/home/USER/.ssh/id_rsa):
```

2. Press **Enter** to confirm the default location, `~/.ssh/id_rsa`, for the newly created key.
3. Enter a passphrase, and confirm it by entering it again when prompted to do so. For security reasons, avoid using the same password as you use to log in to your account.
    
    After this, you will be presented with a message similar to this:

```
Your identification has been saved in /home/USER/.ssh/id_rsa.
Your public key has been saved in /home/USER/.ssh/id_rsa.pub.
The key fingerprint is:
SHA256:UNIgIT4wfhdQH/K7yqmjsbZnnyGDKiDviv492U5z78Y USER@penguin.example.com
The key's randomart image is:
+---[RSA 2048]----+
|o ..==o+.    |
|.+ . .=oo    |
| .o. ..o     |
| ... ..    |
|    .S    |
|o .   .    |
|o+ o .o+ ..   |
|+.++=o*.o .E   |
|BBBo+Bo. oo   |
+----[SHA256]-----+
```

4. By default, the permissions of the `~/.ssh/` directory are set to `rwx------` or `700` expressed in octal notation. This is to ensure that only the _USER_ can view the contents.

5. To copy the public key to a remote machine, issue a command in the following format:

 ```
 ssh-copy-id user@hostname
```

This will copy the most recently modified `~/.ssh/id*.pub` public key if it is not yet installed. Alternatively, specify the public key’s file name as follows:

```
ssh-copy-id -i ~/.ssh/id_rsa.pub user@hostname
```

This will copy the content of `~/.ssh/id_rsa.pub` into the `~/.ssh/authorized_keys` file on the machine to which you want to connect. If the file already exists, the keys are appended to its end.
