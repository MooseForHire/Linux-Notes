# Viewing System Processes

The `ps` command allows you to display information about running processes. It produces a static list, that is, a snapshot of what is running when you execute the command. If you want a constantly updated list of running processes, use the `top` command or the **System Monitor** application instead.

To list all processes that are currently running on the system including processes owned by other users, type the following at a shell prompt:

```none
ps ax
```

For each listed process, the `ps ax` command displays the process ID (`PID`), the terminal that is associated with it (`TTY`), the current status (`STAT`), the cumulated CPU time (`TIME`), and the name of the executable file (`COMMAND`).

```
~]$ ps ax
PID TTY   STAT  TIME COMMAND
 1 ?    Ss   0:01 /usr/lib/systemd/systemd --switched-root --system --deser
 2 ?    S   0:00 [kthreadd]
 3 ?    S   0:00 [ksoftirqd/0]
 5 ?    S>   0:00 [kworker/0:0H]
```

To display the owner alongside each process, use the following command:

```none
ps aux
```

Apart from the information provided by the `ps ax` command, `ps aux` displays the effective user name of the process owner (`USER`), the percentage of the CPU (`%CPU`) and memory (`%MEM`) usage, the virtual memory size in kilobytes (`VSZ`), the non-swapped physical memory size in kilobytes (`RSS`), and the time or date the process was started.

```
~]$ ps aux
USER PID %CPU %MEM  VSZ  RSS TTY  STAT START  TIME COMMAND
root  1 0.3 0.3 134776 6840 ?   Ss  09:28  0:01 /usr/lib/systemd/systemd --..
root  2 0.0 0.0   0   0 ?   S  09:28  0:00 [kthreadd]
root  3 0.0 0.0   0   0 ?   S  09:28  0:00 [ksoftirqd/0]
root  5 0.0 0.0   0   0 ?   S>  09:28  0:00 [kworker/0:0H]
```
