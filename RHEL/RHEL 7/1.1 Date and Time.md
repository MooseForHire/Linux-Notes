 In Red Hat Enterprise Linux 7, time keeping is ensured by the **`NTP`** protocol, which is implemented by a daemon running in user space. The user space daemon updates the system clock running in the kernel. The system clock can keep time by using various clock sources.

Daemons:

`chronyd` : Used by default. It is available from the chrony package.

`ntpd` : If you want to use ntpd instead of chronyd, you need to disable chrony, install and enable ntpd.

To display time:

`timedatectl
