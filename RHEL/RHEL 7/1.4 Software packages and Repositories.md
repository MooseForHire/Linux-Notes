All software on RHEL systems are divided into RPM packages, which are stored in particular repositories.

When a system is subscribed to the Red Hat Content Delivery Network, a repository file is created in the `/etc/yum.repos.d/` directory

Use the `yum` utility to manage package operations

Some operations you might use:

# List all available repositories:

`~]# subscription-manager repos --list`

# List all currently enabled repositories:

``~]$ yum repolist

# Searching for packages matching a specific string:

``~]$ yum search [string]

Installing a package:

``~]# yum install [package_name]

# Updating all packages and their dependencies:

`~]# yum update`

# Updating a specific package:

`yum update [package_name]`

# Uninstalling a package and any packages that depend on it:

`~]# yum remove package_name`

# Listing information on all installed and available packages:

``~]$ yum list all

# Listing information on all installed packages:

`~]$ yum list installed
