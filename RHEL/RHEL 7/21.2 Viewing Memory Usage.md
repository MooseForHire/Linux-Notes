# Using the free Command

The `free` command allows you to display the amount of free and used memory on the system.

The `free` command provides information about both the physical memory (`Mem`) and swap space (`Swap`).

It displays the total amount of memory (`total`), as well as the amount of memory that is in use (`used`), free (`free`), shared (`shared`), sum of buffers and cached (`buff/cache`), and available (`available`).

By default, `free` displays the values in kilobytes. To display the values in megabytes, supply the `-m` command line option:

```none
free -m
```
