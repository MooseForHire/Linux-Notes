Systemd is a system and service manager for Linux OS's that introduces the concept of systemd units.

You can determine services that are enabled or disabled at boot time already during the installation process, or you can enable or disable a service on an installed operating system.

# To enable or disable a service on an already installed operating system:

`~]# systemctl enable service_name
``~]# systemctl disable service_name
