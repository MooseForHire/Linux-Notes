When a software or hardware failure breaks the system, the system administrator faces three tasks to restore it to the fully functioning state on a new hardware environment:

1. booting a rescue system on the new hardware
2. replicating the original storage layout
3. restoring user and system files

Most backup software solves only the third problem. To solve the first and second problems, useÂ _Relax-and-Recover (ReaR)_, a disaster recovery and system migration utility.
