In order to run an OpenSSH server, you must have the **openssh-server** package installed.

To start the `sshd` daemon in the current session, type the following at a shell prompt as `root`:

``~]# systemctl start sshd.service

To stop the running `sshd` daemon in the current session, use the following command as `root`:

``~]# systemctl stop sshd.service

Note that if you reinstall the system (sshd), a new set of identification keys will be created. As a result, clients who had connected to the system with any of the OpenSSH tools before the reinstall will see the following message:

```
@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@
@: REMOTE HOST IDENTIFICATION HAS CHANGED!   @
@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@
IT IS POSSIBLE THAT SOMEONE IS DOING SOMETHING NASTY!
Someone could be eavesdropping on you right now (man-in-the-middle attack)!
It is also possible that the RSA host key has just been changed.
```

# Using Key-based Authentication

To improve the system security even further, generate SSH key pairs and then enforce key-based authentication by disabling password authentication.

To do so, open the `/etc/ssh/sshd_config` configuration file in a text editor such as **vi** or **nano**, and change the `PasswordAuthentication` option as follows:

`PasswordAuthentication no
