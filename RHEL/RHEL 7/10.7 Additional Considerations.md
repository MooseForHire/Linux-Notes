During normal operation, systemd maintains an association between a unit abstraction and the underlying processes active on the system.

From: `man systemd`

```
Processes systemd spawns are placed in individual Linux control groups named after the unit which they belong to in the private systemd hierarchy.systemd uses this to effectively keep track of processes. Control group information is maintained in the kernel, and is accessible via the file system hierarchy (beneath /sys/fs/cgroup/systemd/), or in tools such as ps(1) (ps xawf -eo pid,user,cgroup,args is particularly useful to list all processes and the systemd units they belong to).
```

The cgroup hierarchy is critical to systemd’s view of process and service health. When a process forks itself, it inherits the cgroup of the creating process.

In order for systemd to function properly, the service must be started or stopped through the systemd system to maintain the correct process to unit grouping. Any operation that takes external action results in the necessary cgroup structure not being created. This happens because systemd is not aware of the special nature of the processes being started.

As an example of the above constraint, stopping the `httpd` service and then issuing `/usr/sbin/httpd` directly results in the following:

```
~]# systemctl stop httpd
~]# /usr/sbin/httpd
# systemd-cgls | head -17
├─1 /usr/lib/systemd/systemd --switched-root --system --deserialize 22
├─user.slice
│ └─user-0.slice
│  └─session-168.scope
│   ├─ 3049 login -- root
│   ├─11884 -bash
│   ├─11957 /usr/sbin/httpd
│   ├─11958 /usr/sbin/httpd
│   ├─11959 /usr/sbin/httpd
│   ├─11960 /usr/sbin/httpd
│   ├─11961 /usr/sbin/httpd
│   ├─11962 /usr/sbin/httpd
│   ├─11963 systemd-cgls
│   └─11964 head -17
└─system.slice
 ├─rhnsd.service
 │ └─3261 rhnsd
```


Note that the `httpd` process is now visible under the user-0.slice and a session-168.scope. This service is treated as a user started process, as opposed to a system service, that systemd should monitor and manage directly.
