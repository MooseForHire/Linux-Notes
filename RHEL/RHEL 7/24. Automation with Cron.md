`Cron` is a service that enables you to schedule running a task, often called a job, at regular times. A `cron` job is only executed _if the system is running_ on the scheduled time.

Users specify **cron** jobs in cron table files, also called `crontab` files. These files are then read by the `crond` service, which executes the jobs.

##### Scheduling a Job as root User

The `root` user uses the cron table in `/etc/crontab`, or, preferably, creates a cron table file in `/etc/cron.d/`.

##### Scheduling Hourly, Daily, Weekly, and Monthly Jobs

To schedule an hourly, daily, weekly, or monthly job:

1. Put the actions you want your job to execute into a shell script.
2. Put the shell script into one of the following directories:
    
    - `/etc/cron.hourly/`
    - `/etc/cron.daily/`
    - `/etc/cron.weekly/`
    - `/etc/cron.monthly/`
    

From now, your script will be executed - the `crond` service automatically executes any scripts present in `/etc/cron.hourly`, `/etc/cron.daily`, `/etc/cron.weekly`, and `/etc/cron.monthly` directories at their corresponding times.
