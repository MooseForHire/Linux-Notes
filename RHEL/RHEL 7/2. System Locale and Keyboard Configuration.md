The _system locale_ specifies the language settings of system services and user interfaces. The _keyboard layout_ settings control the layout used on the text console and graphical user interfaces.

These settings can be made by modifying the `/etc/locale.conf` configuration file or by using the `localectl` utility.

The basic file format of `/etc/locale.conf` is a newline-separated list of variable assignments. For example, German locale with English messages in `/etc/locale.conf` looks as follows:

LANG=de_DE.UTF-8
LC_MESSAGES=C

Here, the LC_MESSAGES option determines the locale used for diagnostic messages written to the standard error output.

LANG = Language used

The `localectl` command can be used to query and change the system locale and keyboard layout settings. To show the current settings, use the `status` option:

```none
localectl
```

The output of the previous command lists the currently set locale, keyboard layout configured for the console and for the X11 window system.

```
~]$ localectl status
  System Locale: LANG=en_US.UTF-8
    VC Keymap: us
    X11 Layout: n/a
```
