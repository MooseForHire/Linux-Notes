#### Normal and System Accounts

Normal accounts are created for users of a particular system. Such accounts can be added, removed, and modified during normal system administration.

System accounts represent a particular applications identifier on a system. Such accounts are generally added or manipulated only at software installation time, and they are not modified later.

For system accounts, user IDs below 1000 are reserved. For normal accounts, you can use IDs starting at 1000. However, the recommended practice is to assign IDs starting at 5000.

The guidelines for assigning IDs can be found in the `/etc/login.defs` file.

```
# Min/max values for automatic uid selection in useradd
#
UID_MIN         1000
UID_MAX         60000
# System accounts
SYS_UID_MIN        201
SYS_UID_MAX        999
```

#### What Groups Are and Which Purposes They Can Be Used For

A group is an entity which ties together multiple user accounts for a common purpose, such as granting access to particular files.

- Displaying user and group IDs:
    
    ~]$ `id`
    
- Creating a new user account:
    
    ~]# useradd [options] _user_name_
    
- Assigning a new password to a user account belonging to _username_:
    
    ~]# passwd _user_name_
    
- Adding a user to a group:
    
    ~]# usermod -a -G group_name user_name
