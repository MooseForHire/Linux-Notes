To store your passphrase so that you do not have to enter it each time you initiate a connection with a remote machine, you can use the `ssh-agent` authentication agent.

If you are running GNOME, you can configure it to prompt you for your passphrase whenever you log in and remember it during the whole session. Otherwise you can store the passphrase for a certain shell prompt.

To save your passphrase for a certain shell prompt, use the following command:

```
~]$ ssh-add
Enter passphrase for /home/USER/.ssh/id_rsa:
```
