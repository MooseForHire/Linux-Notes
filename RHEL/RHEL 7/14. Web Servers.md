A _web server_ is a network service that serves content to a client over the web. This typically means web pages, but any other documents can be served as well. Web servers are also known as HTTP servers, as they use the _hypertext transport protocol_ (**HTTP**).

The web servers available in Red Hat Enterprise Linux 7 are:

- Apache HTTP Server
- nginx


# Apache

This section focuses on the **Apache HTTP Server 2.4**, `httpd`, an open source web server developed by the [Apache Software Foundation](http://www.apache.org/).

When the `httpd` service is started, by default, it reads the configuration from:

|Path|Description|
|:--|:--|
|`/etc/httpd/conf/httpd.conf`|The main configuration file.|
|`/etc/httpd/conf.d/`|An auxiliary directory for configuration files that are included in the main configuration file.|

# Setting up an SSL Server

_Secure Sockets Layer_ (**SSL**) is a cryptographic protocol that allows a server and a client to communicate securely. Along with its extended and improved version called _Transport Layer Security_ (**TLS**), it ensures both privacy and data integrity.

The Apache HTTP Server in combination with `mod_ssl`, a module that uses the OpenSSL toolkit to provide the SSL/TLS support, is commonly referred to as the _SSL server_.

Unlike an HTTP connection that can be read and possibly modified by anybody who is able to intercept it, the use of SSL/TLS over HTTP, referred to as HTTPS, prevents any inspection or modification of the transmitted content.
