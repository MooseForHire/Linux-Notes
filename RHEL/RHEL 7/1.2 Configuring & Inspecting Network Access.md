Network access is usually configured during the installation process. 

`nmcli`  : Command line utility to configure network access
`nmtui`  : Text user-interface to configure network access

You can use these to add one or more new network connections, as well as modify and inspect the existing connections.

To create a new connection:

`[~]# nmcli con add type "con-name"  ifname  ipv4 address gw4 address

To display all connections:

`nmcli con show`

To display active connections:

`nmcli con show --active`
