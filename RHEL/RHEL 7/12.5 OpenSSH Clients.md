To connect to an OpenSSH server from a client machine, you must have the **openssh-clients** package installed

The `ssh` utility allows you to log in to a remote machine and execute commands there.

```
ssh penguin.example.com
```

This will log you in with the same user name you are using on the local machine. If you want to specify a different user name, use a command in the following form:

```
ssh username@hostname
```

The first time you initiate a connection, you will be presented with a message similar to this:

```
The authenticity of host 'penguin.example.com' can't be established.
ECDSA key fingerprint is SHA256:vuGKK9dsW34zrZzwjl5g+vOE6EZQvHRQ8zObKYO2mW4.
ECDSA key fingerprint is MD5:7e:15:c3:03:4d:e1:dd:ee:99:dc:3e:f4:b9:67:6b:62.
Are you sure you want to continue connecting (yes/no)?
```

If the user has access to the server’s host keys, the fingerprint can be checked by using the `ssh-keygen` command as follows:

```
~]# ssh-keygen -l -f /etc/ssh/ssh_host_ecdsa_key.pub
SHA256:vuGKK9dsW34zrZzwjl5g+vOE6EZQvHRQ8zObKYO2mW4
```



# ! IMPORTANT !

If the SSH server’s host key changes, the client notifies the user that the connection cannot proceed until the server’s host key is deleted from the `~/.ssh/known_hosts` file. Before doing this, however, contact the system administrator of the SSH server to verify the server is not compromised.

To remove a key from the `~/.ssh/known_hosts` file, issue a command as follows:

```
~]# ssh-keygen -R penguin.example.com
# Host penguin.example.com found: line 15 type ECDSA
/home/USER/.ssh/known_hosts updated.
Original contents retained as /home/USER/.ssh/known_hosts.old
```
