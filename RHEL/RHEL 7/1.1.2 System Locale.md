System-wide locale settings are stored in /etc/locale.conf, which is read at early boot by the systemd daemon. The settings configured here are inherited by every service or user unless individual programs or users override them

A **locale** is a set of environmental variables that defines the language, country, and character encoding settings (or any other special variant preferences) for your applications and shell session on a Linux system. These environmental variables are used by system libraries and locale-aware applications on the system.

**Locale** affects things such as the time/date format, the first day of the week, numbers, currency and many other values formatted in accordance with the language or region/country you set on a Linux system
