Files and directories have permission sets for the owner of the file, the group associated with the file, and all other users for the system. However, these permission sets have limitations. For example, different permissions cannot be configured for different users. Thus, _Access Control Lists_ (ACLs) were implemented.

The Red Hat Enterprise Linux kernel provides ACL support for the ext3 file system and NFS-exported file systems. ACLs are also recognized on ext3 file systems accessed via Samba.

Along with support in the kernel, the `acl` package is required to implement ACLs. It contains the utilities used to add, modify, remove, and retrieve ACL information.

The `cp` and `mv` commands copy or move any ACLs associated with files and directories.

========================================================

There are two types of ACLs: _access ACLs_ and _default ACLs_. An access ACL is the access control list for a specific file or directory. 

A default ACL can only be associated with a directory; if a file within the directory does not have an access ACL, it uses the rules of the default ACL for the directory. Default ACLs are optional.

ACLs can be configured:

1. Per user
2. Per group
3. Via the effective rights mask
4. For users not in the user group for the file

The `setfacl` utility sets ACLs for files and directories. Use the `-m` option to add or modify the ACL of a file or directory:

`# setfacl -m [rules] [files]
