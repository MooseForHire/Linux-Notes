The logging system in Red Hat Enterprise Linux 7 is based on the built-in **syslog** protocol. Particular programs use this system to record events and organize them into log files, which are useful when auditing the operating system and troubleshooting various problems.

The syslog messages are handled by two services:

- the `systemd-journald` daemon - Collects messages from the kernel, the early stages of the boot process, standard output and error of daemons as they start up and run, and syslog, and forwards the messages to the `rsyslog` service for further processing.

- the `rsyslog` service - Sorts the syslog messages by type and priority, and writes them to the files in the `/var/log` directory, where the logs are persistently stored.

The syslog messages are stored in various subdirectories under the `/var/log` directory according to what kind of messages and logs they contain:

- `var/log/messages` - all syslog messages except those mentioned below
- `var/log/secure` - security and authentication-related messages and errors
- `var/log/maillog` - mail server-related messages and errors
- `var/log/cron` - log files related to periodically executed tasks
- `var/log/boot.log` - log files related to system startup
