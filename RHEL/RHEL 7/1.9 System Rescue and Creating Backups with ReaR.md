When a software or hardware failure breaks the operating system, you need a mechanism to rescue the system. It is also useful to have the system backup saved. Red Hat recommends using the Relax-and-Recover (ReaR) tool to fulfil both these needs.

ReaR is a disaster recovery and system migration utility which enables you to create the complete rescue system. By default, this rescue system restores only the storage layout and the boot loader, but not the actual user and system files.
