**Systemd** is a system and service manager for Linux operating systems. It is designed to be backwards compatible with SysV init scripts, and provides a number of features such as parallel startup of system services at boot time, on-demand activation of daemons, or dependency-based service control logic. In Red Hat Enterprise Linux 7, systemd replaces Upstart as the default init system.

Systemd introduces the concept of _systemd units_. These units are represented by unit configuration files located in one of the directories listed:

|Directory|Description|
|:--|:--|
|`/usr/lib/systemd/system/`|Systemd unit files distributed with installed RPM packages.|
|`/run/systemd/system/`|Systemd unit files created at run time. This directory takes precedence over the directory with installed service unit files.|
|`/etc/systemd/system/`|Systemd unit files created by `systemctl enable` as well as unit files added for extending a service. This directory takes precedence over the directory with runtime unit files.|


The available system unit types are:

|Unit Type|File Extension|Description|
|:--|:--|:--|
|Service unit|`.service`|A system service.|
|Target unit|`.target`|A group of systemd units.|
|Automount unit|`.automount`|A file system automount point.|
|Device unit|`.device`|A device file recognized by the kernel.|
|Mount unit|`.mount`|A file system mount point.|
|Path unit|`.path`|A file or directory in a file system.|
|Scope unit|`.scope`|An externally created process.|
|Slice unit|`.slice`|A group of hierarchically organized units that manage system processes.|
|Snapshot unit|`.snapshot`|A saved state of the systemd manager.|
|Socket unit|`.socket`|An inter-process communication socket.|
|Swap unit|`.swap`|A swap device or a swap file.|
|Timer unit|`.timer`|A systemd timer.|

The default configuration of systemd is defined during the compilation and it can be found in systemd configuration file at `/etc/systemd/system.conf`. Use this file if you want to deviate from those defaults and override selected default values for systemd units globally.
