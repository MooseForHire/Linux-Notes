Activation of the `kdump` service is a part of the installation process, and by default, **kdump** was enabled during the installation.

In case of a system crash, you can use the Kernel crash dump mechanism called **kdump** that enables you to save the content of the system’s memory for later analysis.

When kernel crash occurs, **kdump** uses kexec to boot into a second kernel (a capture kernel), which resides in a reserved part of the system memory that is inaccessible to the first kernel. The second kernel captures the contents of the crashed kernel’s memory (a crash dump) and saves it.

1. To check whether **kdump** is installed on your system:
    ~]$ `rpm -q kexec-tools`
