Buffering is the process of preloading data into a reserved area of memory called buffer memory.

**Buffer memory is a temporary storage area in the main memory (RAM) that stores data transferring between two or more devices or between an application and a device.**Â Buffering compensates for the difference in transfer speeds between the sender and receiver of the data.
