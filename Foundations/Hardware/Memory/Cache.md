Caching is the process of temporarily storing a copy of a given resource so that subsequent requests to the same resource are processed faster.

**Cache memory is a fast, static random access memory (SRAM) that a computer chip can access more efficiently than the standard dynamic random access memory (DRAM)**. It can exist in either RAM or a hard disk. Caching in RAM is referred to as memory caching, while caching in a hard disk is referred to as disk caching.

Whenever a program requests data from the hard disk, the system first checks the cache memory. It only checks the hard disk if the requested data isnâ€™t present in the cache memory. This greatly improves data processing because accessing it directly from the hard disk is slower.
