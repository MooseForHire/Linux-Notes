PAM

Provides an API that privelege granting programs defer to in order to perform standard authentication tasks e.g. --- `login` and `su`

  Sys admin is free to choose how individual service-providing applications will authenticate users. **Linux-PAM** configuration file `/etc/pam.conf`

Alternatively, the configuration can be set by individual configuration files located in the `/etc/pam.d/` directory. The presence of this directory will cause **Linux-PAM** to _ignore_ `/etc/pam.conf.`

Vendor-supplied PAM configuration files might be installed in the system directory `/usr/lib/pam.d/`
   
The important point to recognize is that the configuration file(s) _define_ the connection between applications (**services**) and the pluggable authentication modules (**PAM**s) that perform the actual authentication tasks.
