Most conventional network services use password-based authentication schemes, where a user supplies a password to access a given network server. However, the transmission of authentication information for many services is unencrypted. For such a scheme to be secure, the network has to be inaccessible to outsiders, and all computers and users on the network must be trusted and trustworthy.

With simple, password-based authentication, a network that is connected to the Internet cannot be assumed to be secure. Any attacker who gains access to the network can use a simple packet analyzer, or _packet sniffer_, to intercept user names and passwords, compromising user accounts and, therefore, the integrity of the entire security infrastructure.

Kerberos eliminates the transmission of unencrypted passwords across the network and removes the potential threat of an attacker sniffing the network.

Rather than authenticating each user to each network service separately as with simple password authentication, Kerberos uses symmetric encryption and a trusted third party (a _key distribution center_ or KDC) to authenticate users to a suite of network services. The computers managed by that KDC and any secondary KDCs constitute a _realm_.

When a user authenticates to the KDC, the KDC sends a set of credentials (a _ticket_) specific to that session back to the user's machine, and any Kerberos-aware services look for the ticket on the user's machine rather than requiring the user to authenticate using a password.

Each user is identified to the KDC with a unique identity, called a _principal_.

When a user on a Kerberos-aware network logs into his workstation, his principal is sent to the KDC as part of a request for a _ticket-granting ticket_ (or TGT) from the authentication server. This request can be sent by the login program so that it is transparent to the user or can be sent manually by a user through the `kinit` program after the user logs in.

The KDC then checks for the principal in its database. If the principal is found, the KDC creates a TGT, encrypts it using the user's key, and sends the TGT to that user.

The login or `kinit` program on the client then decrypts the TGT using the user's key, which it computes from the user's password. The user's key is used only on the client machine and is _not_ transmitted over the network. The ticket (or credentials) sent by the KDC are stored in a local store, the _credential cache (ccache)_, which can be checked by Kerberos-aware services.

This credential cache can be:

KEYRING ccache

The System Security Services Daemon (SSSD) Kerberos Credential Manager (KCM)

With SSSD KCM, the Kerberos caches are not stored in a passive store, but managed by a daemon. In this setup, the Kerberos library, which is typically used by applications such as `kinit`, is a KCM client and the daemon is referred to as a KCM server.
