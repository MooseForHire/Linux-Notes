A kernel scheduler is a unit of the kernel that determines the most suitable process out of all runnable processes to execute next; it allocates processor time between the runnable processes on a system. A runnable process is one which is waiting only for CPU time, it’s ready to be executed.

The scheduler forms the core of multitasking in Linux, using a priority-based scheduling algorithm to choose between the runnable processes in the system. It ranks processes based on the most deserving as well as the need for CPU time.


## Process Priority and Nice Value


There are a total of **140** priorities and two distinct priority ranges implemented in Linux.

 - `NI `- The first one is a nice value (**niceness**) which ranges from `-20` (highest priority value) to `19` (lowest priority value) and the default is `0` . ( User Space)

- `PR or PRI `- The other is the ACTUAL priority, which ranges from **1** to **99** by default, then **100** to **139** are meant for user-space.


 User space, Nice Value Range:  -20 to 19. 100 to 139.... This gives 39 Priority levels.
 Real Time Priority Range: 0 to 99.
