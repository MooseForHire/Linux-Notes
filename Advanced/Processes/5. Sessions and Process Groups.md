Ok so, as a user on a Linux system, we use processes for example, opening a shell. We type commands that run more processes so on and so forth...

In order to manage all of the processes, the kernel needs to group processes in ways more complicated than simple parent-child relationships.

These groupings are called sessions and process groups.

When a user logs out of a system, the kernel needs to terminate all the processes the user had running (otherwise, users would leave a slew of old processes sitting around waiting for input that can never arrive).

To simplify this task, processes are organized into sets of **sessions**

The session's ID is the same as the pid of the process that created the session through the setsid() system call. That is known as the session leader for that session group.

All of that processes' descendants are then members of that session, unless they specifically remove themselves from it.


## Controlling Terminal

Every session is tied to a terminal from which processes in the session get their input and to which they send their output. The terminal to which a session is related is called the **controlling terminal** (or **controlling tty**) of the session. A terminal can be the controlling terminal for only one session at a time.

## Process Groups

One of the original design goals of Unix was to construct a set of simple tools that could be used together in complex ways (through mechanisms like pipes):

```
ls | grep "^[aA].*\.gz" | more
```

Another popular feature added to Unix fairly early was job control. Job control allows users to suspend the current task (known as the **foreground** task) while they go and do something else on their terminals.

When the suspended task is a sequence of processes working together, the system needs to keep track of which processes should be suspended when the user wants to suspend the foreground task.

Process groups allow the system to keep track of which processes are working together and hence should be managed together via **job control.**

When the connection to a terminal is lost, the kernel sends a signal (SIGHUP) to the leader of the session containing the terminal's foreground process group, which is usually the shell. This allows the shell to terminate the user's processes unconditionally, notify the processes that the user has logged out (usually, through a SIGHUP), or take some other action (or inaction)


## Orphaned Process Groups


The mechanism for how processes are terminated (or allowed to continue) when their session disappears is quite complicated.

Imagine a session with multiple process groups in it - refer to figure above - The session is being run on a terminal, and a normal system shell is the session leader.

When the session leader (the shell) exits, the process groups are left in a difficult situation. 

- If they are actively running, they can no longer use stdin or stdout as the terminal has been closed. 

- If they have been suspended, they will probably never run again as the user of that terminal cannot easily restart them, but never running means they will not terminate either.

In this situation, each process group is called an **orphaned process group**.

ie, If a process group is suspended and there is not a process around that can tell it to continue, the process group is orphaned.

When the shell exits, any of its child programs become children of init, but stay in their original session. Assuming that every program in the session is a descendant of the shell, all of the process groups in that session become orphaned.

When a process group is orphaned, every process in that process group is sent a SIGHUP, which normally terminates the program.

Programs that have chosen not to terminate on SIGHUP are sent a SIGCONT, which resumes any suspended processes. This sequence terminates most processes and makes sure that any processes that are left are able to run (are not suspended).

Once a process has been orphaned, it is forcibly disassociated from its controlling terminal (to allow a new user to make use of that terminal).
