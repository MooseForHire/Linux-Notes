The kernel makes available quite a bit of information about each process, and some information is passed to new programs when they are loaded. All of this information forms the execution environment for a process.

## Program Arguments

There are two types of values passed to new programs when they are run: **command-line arguments** and **environment variables**.

- Command-line arguments are a set of strings passed to the program. Example: `ps -ef`

- Environment variables are a set of name/value pairs. Each pair is represented as a single string of the form _NAME=VALUE,_ and the set of these strings makes up the program's **environment**.

Both the command-line arguments and environment are made available to a program at startup.

- The command-line arguments are passed as parameters to the program's main() function. 

- A pointer to the environment is stored in the environ global variable, which is defined in <unistd.h>.
