## System Call 

When you run a program which calls `open`, `fork`, `read`, `write` (and many others) you are making a system call.

A **system call** is a **controlled entry point into the kernel**, allowing a process to request that the kernel perform some action for the process.

Actually, a system call changes the processor state from user mode to kernel mode, so that the CPU can access protected kernel memory.

For example, if a user program needs to do some sort of IO (`open`, `read`, `write`, etc) or modify its address space (`mmap`, `sbrk`, etc) it must trigger the kernel to run to complete those actions on its behalf.


# **File Descriptor**

In simple words, when you open a file, the operating system creates an entry (a number) to represent that file and store the information about that opened file.  

This entry number is the file descriptor. It is just an integer number that uniquely represents an opened file for the process.



## exec() system call

An **exec** function **replaces** the current process with a new process specified by the **path** or **file** argument. We can use **exec** to **hand off** execution of our program to another.


Example:

1. A user runs the command from their shell:

```
ls -l /var/log/
```

2. The shell uses the system call `fork()` to split the command into a Parent Process and a Child Process.
3. The child process uses the system call exec() to run `ls -l` by replacing itself with the command.


## **fork()** 

Fork is a way of creating threads. When called on a process, it duplicates the current process - much in the same way exec() creates a Parent-Child relationship.

 - The key point to `fork` is to realize that **after** it has completed its work, two processes exist, and in each process, execution continues from the point where fork returns.


```
1.Parent Process running program A calls fork() -- becomes Parent process. Returns the value of the child process' PID.
  
2. Child Process running program A is spawned. It executes the same code as its Parent, but has its own data space, environment, and file descriptor. Returns 0.
```

## Signals

The common communication channel between user space program and kernel is given by the system calls. But there is a different channel, that of the _signals_, used both between user processes and from kernel to user process.
