### 4.1.1.Â Creating a GPG key

**Procedure**

1. Generate a GNU Privacy Guard (GPG) key pair:
    
```
    # gpg --gen-key
```
    
2. Confirm and see the generated key:
    
 ```
   # gpg --list-keys
```
    
3. Export the public key:
    
```
    # gpg --export -a '<Key_name>' > RPM-GPG-KEY-pmanager
```
    
    Note
    
    Include the real name that you have selected for the key instead of <Key_name>.
    
4. Import the exported public key into an RPM database:
    
```
    # rpm --import RPM-GPG-KEY-pmanager
```
