Once source code is on a system, patches are used on it to update it.

The original source code is not modified.

A patch is formatted as a _diff_, because it represents what is different between two versions of the text. A _diff_ is created using the `diff` utility, which is then applied to the source code using the [patch](http://savannah.gnu.org/projects/patch/) utility.
