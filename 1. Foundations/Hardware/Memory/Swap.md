Swap Memory:

Swap memory is a type of memory management in Linux that allows the operating system to use a portion of the hard drive as if it were RAM memory. When your computer runs out of available physical memory (RAM) for running programs, the operating system can move inactive or less frequently used memory pages from RAM to the swap space on the hard drive.

The swap memory works as a temporary storage location for data that is not currently in use, freeing up space in the RAM for other active processes. When a process needs to access data that is in the swap space, the operating system will move it back to the RAM.

While swap memory can be useful for preventing system crashes and improving overall system performance, it's important to note that using swap memory is much slower than using physical RAM. This means that if your system is frequently using swap memory, it may indicate that you need to add more RAM to your system or reduce the number of running programs. In general, it's recommended to avoid excessive use of swap memory, as it can significantly slow down your system performance.
