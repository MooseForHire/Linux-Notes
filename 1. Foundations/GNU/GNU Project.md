GNU is a free and open-source software project that was launched by Richard Stallman in 1983 with the goal of creating a complete, [[Unix-like]] [[Operating System]] **composed entirely of free software.** The name GNU is a recursive acronym that stands for "GNU's Not Unix."

The project aimed to create a [[Unix-like]] system that was compatible with existing [[Unix]] systems but **built entirely with free and open-source software.**

While the GNU project developed a wide range of software tools and utilities, including compilers, text editors, [[shell]]s, and libraries, one critical component was missing: the [[Kernel]]. 

To complete the GNU operating system, a kernel was needed. In 1991, Linus Torvalds released the [[Linux Kernel]], which was compatible with the GNU software, and this led to the combination of the GNU utilities and the [[Linux kernel]] to create what is commonly known as "Linux."

Today, when people refer to "Linux," they often mean a combination of the [[Linux kernel]] and the [[GNU Project]] software tools. However, it's important to recognize that GNU is a distinct project from the Linux kernel. GNU provides the software tools and utilities that form an essential part of many [[Linux Distribution]]s, ensuring that users have a complete operating system experience.


Examples of GNU software used:

1.  GNU Compiler Collection (GCC): GCC is a collection of compilers that supports multiple programming languages, including C, C++, Fortran, Ada, and others. It is widely used for compiling and optimizing code on various platforms.
    
2.  GNU [[Bash]]: Bash (Bourne Again SHell) is a widely used command-line shell and scripting language. It provides a user-friendly interface for interacting with the operating system, executing commands, and writing shell scripts.
    
3.  **GNU Core Utilities: The coreutils package includes essential command-line utilities such as ls (listing files and directories), cp (copying files), mv (moving files), rm (removing files), and many others. These utilities are typically found on most Unix-like systems.**
    
4.  GNU Emacs: Emacs is a highly extensible and customizable text editor. It offers a wide range of features, including support for programming languages, text editing, email, and more.
    
5.  GNU Privacy Guard (GnuPG): GnuPG is a free implementation of the OpenPGP encryption standard. It provides cryptographic privacy and authentication for data communication, allowing users to secure their files, emails, and communications.
    
6.  GNU Make: Make is a build automation tool that helps in managing and building software projects. It allows developers to define a set of rules to compile and link source code efficiently.
    
7.  GNU C Library (glibc): glibc is the C library that provides essential programming functions and system calls for applications running on Linux and other Unix-like systems. It offers a standard API for interacting with the operating system.
    
8.  GNU Debugger (GDB): GDB is a powerful debugger for several programming languages. It helps developers in analyzing and debugging their code, allowing them to track and resolve issues during software development.
